<p>Working in the garden since 2010, the solar energy system continuously provided energy to the solar water pump system for recycling a trickle of water, sourced by Central Contra Costa Sanitary District, in the streambed for plants, birds, insects, and other wildlife.</p>

<p>PHIG Intern Tami Silva, who is in a program at California State University, Maritime Academy, joined on this project because of our sustainable energy practices and to learn project management. She worked with Eric Andersson, the project engineer, who assessed the system, repaired the water pump and irrigation tubing back to water functionality. Separately, Eric, along with Garrett Andersson, solar installer and wastewater treatment technician, updated and redesigned the circuit board, connected it to the solar panels to be waterproof and made the board accessible for teaching purposes.</p>

<p>Volunteers cleaned up the streambed and the area will be replanted. Other repairs such as a new battery, a timer, and a charge controller for the solar energy system along with lighting and technology upgrades are needed to complete the renovation. Help support PHIG with your donation to continue providing water for this wildlife habitat, especially important during this drought.</p>
